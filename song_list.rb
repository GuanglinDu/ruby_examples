# Implements a SongList Container

# An instance variable is not visible outside the object it is in; but when you
# create an attr_accessor, it creates an instance variable and also makes it
# visible (and editable) outside the object. Because attr_accessor defines
# methods, you can call them from outside the class.
# A @variable is only accessible from inside the class.

class Song
  # Readable attributes.
  # Three getting methods, as getters as in Java, to get 3 instance attributes
  # externally, respectivelyã€‚
  #def name
  #  @name
  #end

  #def artist
  #  @artist
  #end

  #def duration
  #  @duration
  #end

  # Writable attributes (setters as in Java)
  # Defining a method name ending in an equals sign makes that name eligible
  # to appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.
  #def duration(new_duration) # wrong!
  #def duration=(new_duration)
  #  @duration = new_duration
  #end

  # The shortcut: attr_reader creates the above 3 reading methods (getters)
  #attr_reader :name, :artist, :duration
  
  # The same applies to writable attributes (setters)
  #attr_writer :name, :artist, :duration
  
  # Both readers and writers (getters & setters)
  attr_accessor :name, :artist, :duration
  
  def initialize(name, artist, duration)
    @name = name
    @artist = artist
    @duration = duration
  end
  
  # Overrides super's to_s methtod
  def to_s
    "Song: #{@name} -- #{@artist} (#{@duration})"
  end
  
  # Accesses the instance variables by a getter/setter
  def access_by_getter
    puts "access_by_the_getter: #{name}"
  end

  def access_by_setter
      self.name = "access_by_the_setter"
    puts "access_by_the_setter: #{name}"
  end

  def initialize
    @songs = Array.new

  # Returns the length of the song list
